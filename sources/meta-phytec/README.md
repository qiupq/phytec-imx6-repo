meta-phytec
===========

This is the official hardware support layer for PHYTEC Boards.
Meta-phytec is a distribution independent layer and delivers bootloader
and kernel to our customers.
If you are interested in a fully tested and configured Linux
distribution, consider installing
[meta-yogurt](git://git.phytec.de/meta-yogurt)
too, which is a test distribution based on Poky, maintained by PHYTEC.

Further information about the hardware can be found on our webpage:

If you experience any problem with this software, please contact our
<support@phytec.de> or the maintainer directly.
Please try to do the following first:

* look in the
  [Yocto Project Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/)
  to see if a problem has already been reported
* look through recent entries of the
  [Yocto mailing list archives](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/)
  to see if other people have run into similar
  problems or had similar questions answered.
